Build a tool which receives a corpus of text, analyses it and reports the top 10 most frequent bigrams,
trigrams, four-grams (i.e. most frequently occurring two, three and four word consecutive combinations).
Extra*: Use a string similarity function to aggregate the “similar” bigrams together: Ex: "the-house" and
"tree-house" will be counted as the same bigram.
